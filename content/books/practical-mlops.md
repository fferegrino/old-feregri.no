 > This is a work in progress, I am still reading this book and as such, my opinion on it may change

I did not quite liked the first two chapters, they are meant to be an introduction to certain topics useful to the MLOps practitioner, however I don't entirely think these are comprehensive enough and feel like a poorly compiled set of disconnected ideas. There are better places to learn what MLOps is, such as the book [Introducing MLOps](#).

It is better that you take a quick crash course into the subjects outlined in the book rather than just staying with the little knowledge you get in the book.

**However, I am not reading this book to get some deeper theoretical knowledge about the subject, but to practice what I already know**.
