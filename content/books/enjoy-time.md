Let's get this out of the way: this book's design is beautiful, ever since I saw it I wanted to buy it, but finally I got the time for it. This is not a review of the book, but rather some notes I took while reading it.

One has to see the time as an organisational device, not as an enemy that we have to defeat throwing as many tasks to it as possible. Pretty much like a compass or a map help us navigate on a day to day basis, time is also a tool that helps us move better into the future.

 > Time is not money. Time is your life.

The book states that we live in a *rushogenic* world, kind of in a way fast-food causes us to overeat, our environment causes us to stuff our time with as many activities as possible, which in turns acts in detriment to our general enjoyment and productivity.

We tend to unerestimate the value of the activities we carry out when we are not getting paid, time spent with friends, time spent reading a novel or even time resting. It is easy to equate being busy to being productive, when this is not the case, I've talk about it in the past: similarly to no sleeping, we sometimes wear our "we are busy" as a badge of honor.

Stop and think: how much of this busyness stems from true productivity and how much is just a cover for your inefficiency. I really like that the book gives some action items to make your business productive.

Among the tips there is the classic: remove all distractions, like out phones as they weaken our concentration and destroy our willpower, if we let them in tend to colonise our time expanding beyond what we initially allowed them to. It may be best to treat social media as a reward for concentrating

 > Time poverty is not a sign of success but powerlessness.

The book also points us to live intentionally, make sure our choices determine our actions. We need to make sure we travel through time with a direction.

I usually keep a to-do list of the activities I expect to perform on a day-to-day basis. I fill it the night before and I have found that it makes me feel productive and guides the decisions I make throughout the day.

 > For every choice you make, something must be refused.

I've spoken about yak shaving before, and this book also covers it briefly: tomorrow never comes. Every time we put off a task we decided was important for one that has no importance our willpower weakens, stick to your decisions, if you find that some other task suddenly appears, just write it down, you can reprioritise it later.

Overall I think it is a great book, filled with advice and "smart quotes" that resonated heavily with me.
