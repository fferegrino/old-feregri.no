Inspired by Nerudista's [post in the Tacos de Datos website (in spanish)](https://tacosdedatos.com/dueno-de-mis-datos-spotify) I asked Spotify for my data and started making some plots with them. If you want to do the same, head over to [this page](https://www.spotify.com/es/account/privacy/); once you request it, it will take a couple of days to be available. In the meantime, you can use this [Google Colab]((https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dnjCKGllq5v1iEUuoQxbROMG0IXfgoiG)), I've created a subset of my data for you to play with.

Among all the information you will receive, there will be some files named following this pattern: `StreamingHistoryXX.json`, and these are the ones we'll use throughout this post.

## The data 

The files mentioned above files contain something like this:


```json
[
  {
    "endTime" : "2019-02-04 17:14",
    "artistName" : "MGMT",
    "trackName" : "Time to Pretend",
    "msPlayed" : 261000
  },
  {
    "endTime" : "2019-02-04 17:18",
    "artistName" : "MGMT",
"..." 
```  

Where the values are: 

 - `endTime`: Day and time in which a song finished, in UTC format.  
 - `artistName`: Name of the artist of the song.  
 - `trackName`: Name of the song.  
 - `msPlayed`: For how long (in milliseconds) a song was played.  

To load these this data into a DataFrame we'll need this tiny function:

```python
from glob import glob
import json
import pandas as pd

def read_history():
    history = []
    for file in sorted(glob("StreamingHistory*.json")):
        with open(file) as readable:
            history.extend(json.load(readable))
    history = pd.DataFrame(history)
    history["endTime"] = pd.to_datetime(history["endTime"])
    return history

streaming_history = read_history()
streaming_history.head(5)
```

Which should give us something like this once we execute it:  

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>endTime</th>
      <th>artistName</th>
      <th>trackName</th>
      <th>msPlayed</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>2019-02-04 17:14:00</td>
      <td>MGMT</td>
      <td>Time to Pretend</td>
      <td>261000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>2019-02-04 17:18:00</td>
      <td>MGMT</td>
      <td>When You Die</td>
      <td>263880</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>2019-02-04 17:23:00</td>
      <td>Mr Dooves</td>
      <td>Super Smash Bros. Brawl Main Theme (From "Super Smash Bros. Brawl") [A Cappella]</td>
      <td>201518</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>  

## Histogram. 

I've always been a fan of the way GitHub shows developer contributions, and the data we got from Spotify seems like the perfect candidate to create something similar; however, we need to perform some transformations first.

Since we are not interested in the time each song finished we'll get rid of the temporal part of `endTime`:  

```python
streaming_history["date"] = streaming_history["endTime"].dt.floor('d')
```

Then we'll get a count of songs per day using `groupby`:  


```python
by_date = streaming_history.groupby("date")[["trackName"]].count()
by_date = by_date.sort_index()
```

For out plot, we'll need to know which day of the week each date refers to, we can use the properties `week` and `weekday`:  

```python
by_date["weekday"] = by_date.index.weekday
by_date["week"] = by_date.index.week
```

By the end, our dataframe should look like this:  

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>trackName</th>
      <th>weekday</th>
      <th>week</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>date</th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>2019-02-04</th>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2019-02-05</th>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2019-02-07</th>
      <td>60</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>  

We have almost everything we need, the next step is to get a contiuous sequence of numbers for each week. In the dataframe above the 6th week of 2016 must be the week 0, the 7th must be the week 1... I can't think of a better way to do it than a `for` loop:  


```python
week = 0
prev_week = by_date.iloc[0]["week"]
continuous_week = np.zeros(len(by_date)).astype(int)
sunday_dates = []
for i, (_, row) in enumerate(by_date.iterrows()):
    if row["week"] != prev_week:
        week += 1
        prev_week = row["week"]
    continuous_week[i] = week
by_date["continuous_week"] = continuous_week 
by_date.head()
```

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>trackName</th>
      <th>weekday</th>
      <th>week</th>
      <th>continuous_week</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>date</th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>2019-02-04</th>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2019-02-05</th>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2019-02-07</th>
      <td>60</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>  

Our next step is to generate a matrix with `days ✕ weeks` as dimensions, where each one of the entries will be the number of songs we listened to in that day and week:  

```python
songs = np.full((7, continuous_week.max()+1), np.nan)

for index, row in by_date.iterrows():
    songs[row["weekday"]][row["continuous_week"]] = row["trackName"]
```

Now we could just plot the matrix `songs` using `seaborn`:  


```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20,5))
ax = plt.subplot()
mask = np.isnan(songs)
sns.heatmap(songs, ax = ax)
```

But the result is not that great:  

![Histograma horrible](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/kq4hxl4yddbzsfqt0yl5.png)  

If we want it to look better we still need some code, the first thing to do is to clean the axis labels:  

```python
min_date = streaming_history["endTime"].min()
first_monday = min_date - timedelta(min_date.weekday())
mons = [first_monday + timedelta(weeks=wk) for wk in range(continuous_week.max())]
x_labels = [calendar.month_abbr[mons[0].month]]
x_labels.extend([
    calendar.month_abbr[mons[i].month] if mons[i-1].month != mons[i].month else "" 
    for i in range(1, len(mons))])

y_labels = ["Mon", "", "Wed", "", "Fri", "", "Sun"]
```

The X axis labels are far more complicated than the Y ones; this is because unlike Y, the X axis is not fixed nor continuous, as such, they need to calculated based on the data. If you want a more detailed explanation, tell me in the comments or [at me on twitter at @feregri_no](https://twitter.com/feregri_no)).

After doing this we'll perform some modifications with colours and the axis:  


```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20,5))
ax = plt.subplot()

ax.set_title("My year on Spotify", fontsize=20,pad=40)
ax.xaxis.tick_top()
ax.tick_params(axis='both', which='both',length=0)
ax.set_facecolor("#ebedf0") 
fig.patch.set_facecolor('white')
```

And finally, we can use *seaborn's* `heatmap` again, this time with a few extr arguments that I will explain later:


```python
sns.heatmap(songs, linewidths=2, linecolor='white', square=True,
            mask=np.isnan(songs), cmap="Greens",
            vmin=0, vmax=100, cbar=False, ax=ax)

ax.set_yticklabels(y_labels, rotation=0)
ax.set_xticklabels(x_labels, ha="left")
```

The arguments are as follows:  

 - `songs`: our matrix with shape `days ✕ weeks` with the counts of songs per day,  
 - `linewidths`: the size of the spacing between each patch,  
 - `linecolor`: the colour of the spacing between each patch,  
 - `square`: this tells the function that we want to keep the aspect ratio `1:1` for each patch,
 - `mask`: a very interesting argument, it will help us "mask" the patches for which there is no recorded value, this argument should be a boolean matrix of the same dimensions as the data being plotted, where each `True` means that that specific value must be masked,
 - `cmap`: the *colormap* to be used, luckily for us, the value "Greens" matches with the colour palette chosen by GitHub,  
 - `vmin`: the value that should be considered as the minimum among our values,
 - `vmax`: the value that should be considered as the maximum among our values, I'd consider 100 to be the maximum, even though my record sits as 190 in a day!  
 - `cbar`: a *boolean* value to indicate whether we want to show the colour bar that usually comes with the *heatmap*,  
 - `ax`: the *axes* our plot should be plotted on.  

And *voilà*, our plot is ready:

It is up to you to modify the plot, may be by adding information about the number of songs, or show the colorbar... a great idea would be to recreate this plot in a framework such as D3.js, but that may well belong to another post.
